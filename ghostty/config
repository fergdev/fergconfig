# This is the configuration file for Ghostty.
#
# This template file has been automatically created at the following
# path since Ghostty couldn't find any existing config files on your system:
#
#   /Users/fergushewson/Library/Application Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/config
#
# The template does not set any default options, since Ghostty ships
# with sensible defaults for all options. Users should only need to set
# options that they want to change from the default.
#
# Run `ghostty +show-config --default --docs` to view a list of
# all available config options and their default values.
#
# Additionally, each config option is also explained in detail
# on Ghostty's website, at https://ghostty.org/docs/config.

# Config syntax crash course
# ==========================
# # The config file consists of simple key-value pairs,
# # separated by equals signs.
# font-family = Iosevka
# window-padding-x = 2
#
# # Spacing around the equals sign does not matter.
# # All of these are identical:
# key=value
# key= value
# key =value
# key = value
#
# # Any line beginning with a # is a comment. It's not possible to put
# # a comment after a config option, since it would be interpreted as a
# # part of the value. For example, this will have a value of "#123abc":
# background = #123abc
#
# # Empty values are used to reset config keys to default.
# key =
#
# # Some config options have unique syntaxes for their value,
# # which is explained in the docs for that config option.
# # Just for example:
# resize-overlay-duration = 4s 200ms

window-padding-y = 6,0

# Valid values:

#   * `true`

#      borders. On macOS this also disables tabs and tab overview.
# 
# The "toggle_window_decoration" keybind action can be used to create
# a keybinding to toggle this setting at runtime.
# 
# Changing this configuration in your configuration and reloading will
# only affect new windows. Existing windows will not be affected.
# 
# macOS: To hide the titlebar without removing the native window borders
#        or rounded corners, use `macos-titlebar-style = hidden` instead.

# which split is focused. To disable this feature, set this value to 1.
# 
# A value of 1 is fully opaque and a value of 0 is fully transparent. Because
# "0" is not useful (it makes the window look very weird), the minimum value
# is 0.15. This value still looks weird but you can at least see what's going
# on. A value outside of the range 0.15 to 1 will be clamped to the nearest

# Customize the macOS app icon.
# 
# This only affects the icon that appears in the dock, application
# switcher, etc. This does not affect the icon in Finder because
# that is controlled by a hardcoded value in the signed application
# bundle and can't be changed at runtime. For more details on what
# exactly is affected, see the `NSApplication.icon` Apple documentation;
# that is the API that is being used to set the icon.
# 
# WARNING: The `custom-style` option is _experimental_. We may change
# the format of the custom styles in the future. We're still finalizing
# the exact layers and customization options that will be available.
# 
# Other caveats:
# 
#   * The icon in the update dialog will always be the official icon.
#     This is because the update dialog is managed through a
#     separate framework and cannot be customized without significant
#     effort.
# 
# Valid values:
# 
#  * `official` - Use the official Ghostty icon.
#  * `blueprint`, `chalkboard`, `microchip`, `glass`, `holographic`,
#    `paper`, `retro`, `xray` - Official variants of the Ghostty icon
#    hand-created by artists (no AI).
#  * `custom-style` - Use the official Ghostty icon but with custom
#    styles applied to various layers. The custom styles must be
#    specified using the additional `macos-icon`-prefixed configurations.
#    The `macos-icon-ghost-color` and `macos-icon-screen-color`
#    configurations are required for this style.

# The opacity level (opposite of transparency) of the background. A value of
# 1 is fully opaque and a value of 0 is fully transparent. A value less than 0
# or greater than 1 will be clamped to the nearest valid value.
# 
# On macOS, background opacity is disabled when the terminal enters native
# fullscreen. This is because the background becomes gray and it can cause
# widgets to show through which isn't generally desirable.
# 
# On macOS, changing this configuration requires restarting Ghostty completely.

# Whether to blur the background when `background-opacity` is less than 1.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#   * a nonnegative integer specifying the *blur intensity*
#   * `false`, equivalent to a blur intensity of 0
#   * `true`, equivalent to the default blur intensity of 20, which is
#     reasonable for a good looking blur. Higher blur intensities may
#     cause strange rendering and performance issues.
# 
# Supported on macOS and on some Linux desktop environments, including:
# 
#   * KDE Plasma (Wayland and X11)
# 
# Warning: the exact blur intensity is _ignored_ under KDE Plasma, and setting
# this setting to either `true` or any positive blur intensity value would
# achieve the same effect. The reason is that KWin, the window compositor
# powering Plasma, only has one global blur setting and does not allow
# applications to specify individual blur settings.
# 
# To configure KWin's global blur setting, open System Settings and go to
# "Apps & Windows" > "Window Management" > "Desktop Effects" and select the
# "Blur" plugin. If disabled, enable it by ticking the checkbox to the left.
# Then click on the "Configure" button and there will be two sliders that
# allow you to set background blur and noise intensities for all apps,
# including Ghostty.
# 
# All other Linux desktop environments are as of now unsupported. Users may
# need to set environment-specific settings and/or install third-party plugins
# in order to support background blur, as there isn't a unified interface for
# doing so.
